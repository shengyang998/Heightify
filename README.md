## How It Works

Heightify uses established ergonomic principles to calculate optimal furniture heights:

- **Chair Height**: Calculated to ensure proper leg positioning with feet flat on the floor and knees at approximately 90 degrees
- **Desk Height**: Determined to maintain proper arm positioning with elbows at roughly 90 degrees when typing

The app provides a comfortable range around these optimal heights to accommodate personal preferences and varying tasks.
